**Diabetes** is a life-long illness that affects millions of people around the world and that has serious long-term negative consequences if not diagnosed early and managed. Early detection is crucial for getting ahead of the disease, and data science can have a significant impact on this.
In this notebook, I would like to create a **machine learning model** that can predict whether a person is suspected to have diabetes or not, using the information about his/her medical history. The dataset I used consists of data such as `glucose`, `BMI`, `insulin`, `age`, and other important factors.
